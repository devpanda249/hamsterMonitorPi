# hamsterMonitorPi
This is a repository to hold all the code for my hamster monitor on the raspberry pi

The project is in two halves, the first half aims to be able to record/display the current temperature for a pet hamster using a raspberry pi and sense hat with push notifications when the temperature reaches x degrees

The second half is to use the same pi to record the hamster using a camera (and probably motioneyeos)

hamsterTemDisplay.py is responsible for collecting the current temperature using a Pi Sense Hat and dispalying it to the sense hat with an animation
